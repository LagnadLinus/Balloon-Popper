**Balloon-Popper**
A simple interactive balloon-popping game built with Python and the Turtle graphics library. Created by Sunil Dangal

**Overview**
The Balloon Popper game lets players inflate and pop a balloon using keyboard inputs, with added features like color changes and deflation options. As the balloon reaches its maximum size, it "pops," and a new balloon appears in a different color. This project explores basic game mechanics using variables, conditions, functions, and keyboard event handling.

**Features**
- Balloon Inflation and Pop: Use the "Up" arrow key to inflate the balloon until it reaches a specific size and pops.
- Deflation: Press the "Down" arrow key to deflate the balloon.
- Color Change on Pop: After each pop, the balloon reappears in a new color (cycling through green, red, and yellow).
- Adjustable Inflation Rate: Change the inflation rate with the "Right" and "Left" arrow keys for more control.
  
**Design and Implementation**
- Design Phase: Includes a diagram, flowchart, and pseudocode for visual and logical reference.
- Implementation: The code is organized in balloon_popper.py, with event-driven programming using the Turtle library.
- Evaluation: Successfully implemented interactive balloon mechanics using conditions, functions, and keyboard input handling.
  
**How to Run**
Clone this repository.
Run balloon_popper.py using Python.
Use the arrow keys to interact with the game.
